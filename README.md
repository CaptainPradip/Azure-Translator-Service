# Text Translator API

## Author: Pradip Nemane

## Purpose:

This is a RESTful API that allows you to translate text from one language to another. It uses the Text Translator service to perform the translations.The Translate Text API is a powerful tool that enables developers to add machine translation capabilities to their applications. With this API, users can easily translate text from one language to another in a variety of scenarios, such as multilingual chatbots, content localization, and more.

The Translate Text API supports a wide range of languages and dialects, making it an ideal solution for applications that require translation across multiple languages.

## Getting Started

To use this API, you will need the following:
To use this API, you will need the following:
- An Translate Text API service. The API is running at http://159.65.162.167:3005/api/v1/translate.

```
Authorization: Basic YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```
 ## Working of Text Translator API 

 The Translator Service API acts as a wrapper over the Azure Translator Service and enables developers to easily access its capabilities. By using this API, developers can build intelligent, multi-language solutions for their applications across all supported languages.

With Translator Service API, users can 
- easily translate text from one language to another, 
- detect the language of a given piece of text, and 
- obtain a list of supported languages.

## Text Translator API Details
The API is available at http://159.65.162.167:3005/api/v1/
 ## Endpoint: **`POST /translate`**
 
 ### API Request

### API Response
The response will be a JSON object containing an array of translation objects, one for each target language. Each translation object will contain the translated text and the target language code. Here is an example response:

```
{
    "translations": [

## Start using the API:
To see how API works, start sending requests to it. 

You can create your own request by following this document, using swagger API [specification](http://159.65.162.167:3005/translator-api-docs) or you can simply import below collection into postman and send request to API.

Steps to send request to API:
 1. Download [POSTMAN Collection](https://github.com/CaptainPradip/Azure-Translator-Service/blob/main/Translator%20Service.postman_collection.json)
 2. In postman select import the downloaded collection. If you're unfamiliar with importing collections into the postman, follow [this guide](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-data-into-postman)
 3. Open the Translator Service request. Add Basic Authentication, refer API Authentication section.
 4. Navigate to Body -> raw
